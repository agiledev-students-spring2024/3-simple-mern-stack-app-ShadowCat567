        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Leena. I am currently a senior at NYU, double majoring in
         Computer Science and Game Design. Despite studying Game Design, I don't 
         actually play very many games, so please don't come to me asking about 
         recommendations. Of the games I do play, my favorites are currently Dungeons
         and Dragons and Baldur's Gate 3.
        </p>
        <p>
        I live with my cat Yin whose main hobbies are sleeping and attempting to 
        climb to the highest location he can find.
        </p>
        </>
